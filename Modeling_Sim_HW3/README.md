# Modelsim-Hw3
Hw3 is about 4 techniques used in system identification to create a mathematical model of a system based on its data. 
1.ARM    2.ARMAX    3.BJ    4.OE
They represent different ways to write equations for a system's output.
ARX (Simpler): A good starting point for initial system modeling when the main influence on the output comes from the inputs.
ARMAX (More Comprehensive): Similar to ARX but also considers past disturbances. Better suited for modeling systems with significant noise or external influences.
BJ (Structured): A specific method for modeling time series data. Focuses on the inherent statistical properties of the data.
OE (Limited): Only captures the system's dynamics and doesn't explicitly model noise. Useful for systems with minimal noise.
The best choice depends on the specific system and the nature of the disturbances it experiences.
