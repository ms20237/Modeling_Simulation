# Modelsim-Hw2
Hw2 is about 2 method in subselection: Forward selection and Backward Elimination
In forward selection, the model starts with no predictors and successively enters significant predictors until reaching a statistical stopping criteria. 
In backward elimination, the model starts with all possible predictors and successively removes non-significant predictors until reaching the stopping criteria.
when we have much data the best method to use is Backward Elimination because is so fast and simple.
but when we have a small mount of data is better to use Forward selection.
