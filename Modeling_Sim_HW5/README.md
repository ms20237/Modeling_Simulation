# Modelsim-Hw5
in this HW we use differnt methods like taylor and Euler and rung kutta for solve equations
Euler's Method: A first-order method that uses the tangent line to approximate the solution.
Taylor Series Method: A higher-order method that uses the Taylor series expansion to approximate the solution.
Runge-Kutta Methods: A family of iterative methods that provide more accurate solutions than Euler's method.
