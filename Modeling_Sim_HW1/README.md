HW1 is about different method for working on data.
we undrestand that  LS is suitable for static datasets with sufficient computational resources, while RLS, especially with variations like forgetting factor and sliding window, is more appropriate for dynamic environments or situations with limited resources. The choice between LS and RLS depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the size and nature of the dataset, computational constraints, and the dynamics of the underlying system.
